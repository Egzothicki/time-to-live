Time to Live

Overview

This is a simple project inspired by my friend. User fills a questionaire and gets their estimated time left to live on a ticking clock. Looking at each passing second of their life.

Setup

Put .env and the users.txt in your .gitignore for security.
Find required dependencies in requirements.txt file.
Run the application with app.py.
The templates/ dir contains the HTML templates used by the application.
The .env file stores environment variables and should not be tracked by Git.

Enjoy, it's Time to Live
